### <a name="Description"></a>Description
Powered by Facebook's React framework, SQL and a dozen other APIs, Flare allows users to feel safer than they ever have before. Flare allows for users to create a list of contacts, group those contacts together, and create several plans for emergency situations. When a user plans to go to an unfamiliar part of town or any other situation they feel uncertain for their safety, they are able to create an automated alert for groups of contacts. 

Perhaps the user is visiting a part of town where they have a few contacts who live nearby. The user is able to send out a flare, telling the relevant contact group what they're doing, who they intend to be with, and when they intend on returning home. If the user doesn't make it home safely, a second flare will be sent out to their group telling them that their friend did not yet return from wherever it was that they went to. If the user so chooses, a third message can be sent to emergency services on their behalf. All of this in an effort to create a backup plan for our users incase something goes awry.

After downloading the repo locally, run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies within the root directory and the `/client` directory. All necessary tables are created upon initiation for the users convenience.
### <a name="Usage"></a>Usage
Flare is best utilized with a large contact list of varying different friends and family across many different locations. Perhaps the user has a group of contacts that is entirely made up of their neighbors so when they leave town, their neighbors are alerted to keep an eye out on their home. Perhaps the user is a college student and needs to walk the length of campus at night, and wants only their friends on campus to be alerted. Maybe you're returning home via Uber after a night of drinking, and you want your friends you were out with and roommate back home to be made aware that you're traveling home via Uber and to be alerted when you arrive safely. There is no end to the different situations wherein Flare would be useful.
